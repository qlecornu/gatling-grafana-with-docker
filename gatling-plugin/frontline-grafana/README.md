# Gatling Enterprise Datasource

Gatling Enterprise ships with built-in support for Grafana.

This datasource enables users to request Gatling Enterprise metrics easily through Grafana dashboards.

Read more about the Gatling Enterprise Datasource through the [official documentation](https://gatling.io/docs/enterprise/self-hosted/reference/current/plugins/grafana/) provided by Gatling Corp.

We have created sample dashboards in the folder `dashboardSamples`. You can import them to your Grafana to recreate the data shown in each Gatling Enterprise reports tab.
